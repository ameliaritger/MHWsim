## What's in this repository?
This repository contains the scripts and files related to the development of a Marine Heatwave Simulator (MHWsim) using a Raspberry Pi, and the data collected during a MHWsim experiment using Corynactis californica as a study organism.

This repository is maintained by Hofmann Lab graduate student Amelia Ritger (GitHub: [@ameliaritger](https://github.com/ameliaritger)) at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, & Marine Biology. Please direct any questions or comments about this repository to [Amelia Ritger](mailto:aritger@ucsb.edu).
